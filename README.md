### I’ve been working with software development since 2021 and I'm currently in my final year of a degree in Systems Analysis and Development. I have hands-on experience in full stack projects, with a strong focus on back-end development, actively participating in all stages of the software lifecycle — from architecture and design to testing, deployment, and monitoring.

### I work primarily with Golang, Node.js, and Java, using frameworks such as Gin, Fastify, and NestJS. I follow best practices like Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Hexagonal Architecture, and Event-Driven Architecture (EDA), while applying proven design patterns to build clean, decoupled, and maintainable systems.

### I have solid experience with message queue systems like RabbitMQ and Redis Streams, and I design data pipelines for high-volume processing. I also leverage Redis for caching strategies to enhance application performance and reduce latency in distributed systems.

### I'm passionate about observability and monitoring, using tools such as Prometheus, Grafana, and OpenTelemetry to create custom dashboards and metrics that support operational visibility and incident response.

### In the DevOps world, I work with Docker, Kubernetes, Rancher, and manage deployments using Helm Charts, ensuring reproducible and scalable infrastructure. I also apply the principles of TAUS (Fault Tolerance, High Availability, Resource Utilization, and Security) to build resilient and production-ready services.

### I care deeply about code quality and reliability, writing unit tests, 2to2 tests, and fuzzy testing, using tools like go-mock, Vitest, and Jest.

### I'm always seeking technical improvement, learning new technologies, and contributing to the development of scalable, resilient, and observable systems.
